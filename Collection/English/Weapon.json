Heavily injured, the beast offered the hero a blade with a peculiar shape in exchange for its life. Able to talk, the beast described how the blade belonged to a great warrior that it had fought in a deadly duel, and the two holes near its handle were from the beast's own teeth. Just as the beast could bite through metal, the edge of this blade could cut through the beast's otherwise impenetrable hide.",
